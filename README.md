# truss-fun
Ongoing work of the truss puzzle. 

Initial attempt has been on macOS 11.x with version 3.x of bash. 

### Initial setup
* If testing/using this on a Mac you will need
    * Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)$ 
    * Install  [coreutils](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/coreutils) using homebrew
    * Listen to Clams Casino "Gorilla" to capture the appropriate magic.
* If using this on Linux the *gdate* command will need to be renamed
to *date* until a condition is added to compensate

### To Do
* Do this in python to avoid purchasing stock in Tylenol, Aleve, etc..
