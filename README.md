# truss-fun
Ongoing work of the truss puzzle. 

Initial attempt has been on macOS 11.x with version 3.x of bash. 

### Initial setup
* If testing/using this on a Mac you will need to
    * Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
        * `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
        * *Not a recommended install method.*
    * Install the [coreutils](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/coreutils) package using homebrew.
        * `brew install coreutils`
    * Listen to Clams Casino "Gorilla" while working to better capture/inspire the appropriate level of magic.
* If using this on Linux, the **gdate** command will need to be renamed
to **date** in the script until a condition is added to compensate (ðŸ˜¬).

### To Do
* Do this in python to avoid purchasing stock in Tylenol, Aleve, etc..
